      <h4>2. Digulist Monument</h4>
      <p>Although it is more popular with the Equator Monument, Pontianak also has other monuments that are not less interesting to visit such as the Digulis Monument for example. The shape is similar to pointy bamboo making it also often known as the Sharp Bamboo Monument. This monument was built to commemorate the services of the youth of West Kalimantan, especially the city of Pontianak in seizing independence.</p>

      The location itself is located on Jl. A. Yani precisely at the Untan roundabout (Tanjungpura University) made it so interesting that it could be an instagramable photo spot.
